    <h2 class="chatgpttitle">What is Chat GPT?</h2>
    <p class="chatgptcontent" id="chatgptcontent">ChatGPT is an AI language model developed by OpenAI. It is based on the GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) architecture, which is a type of deep learning model that has been trained on a massive amount of text data to generate text that is similar to human language.  ChatGPT is designed to generate human-like text based on the input it receives, allowing it to carry out natural language conversations with users. This makes it well-suited for a variety of applications, including customer service, content generation, and language translation, among others.  In essence, ChatGPT is a highly advanced language model that has been trained on a large corpus of text to generate coherent and human-like responses to questions and prompts.</p>

    <h2 class="bardtitle">What is Bard?</h2>
    <p class="bardcontent" id="bardcontent">BARD (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is an AI language model developed by Google. It is a variant of the Transformer architecture, which is a type of deep learning model that has been widely used for natural language processing tasks.  Like other Transformer-based models, BARD is trained on a large corpus of text data to generate text that is similar to human language. It is designed to generate high-quality text that is coherent and well-formed, making it well-suited for a variety of applications, including text generation, language translation, and question answering, among others.  BARD is considered to be one of the largest and most advanced AI language models to date, and is part of Google's ongoing research efforts to improve the state of the art in natural language processing.</p>

    <h2 class="chatgptvsbardtitle">ChatGPT vs Bard</h2>
    <p class="chatgptvsbardcontent" id="chatgptvsbardcontent">In February 2023, Microsoft announced they will release technology for large companies to create and customize their own chatbots using ChatGPT technology. Microsoft will also embed AI-powered search functions to Bing and Edge with chat experience to aid a user's search. These browsers will feature a newer version of ChatGPT using GPT-4, providing more relevant information from the internet.  Google has not announced when it plans to add AI chatbot functionality to its search engines.  The main difference between ChatGPT and Bard is the data source. Bard will continually draw information from the internet, so it will have the latest information. ChatGPT's sources end with 2021 data, so it is limited to newer research and information. Bard will have more data to gather information in real-time by accessing the latest research.  Bard uses its LaMDA for dialogue applications, while ChatGPT uses GPT 3.5. LaMDA was built on an open-source network to understand natural language. It's trained to find patterns in sentences and between words to create dialogue versus individual words.  Bard will create more chunks of information, while ChatGPT creates content in a single text prompt.</p>

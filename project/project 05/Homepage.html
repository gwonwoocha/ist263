    <h2>What is AI?</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are designed to think and act like humans. These machines are programmed to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence such as speech recognition, decision making, pattern recognition, and language translation. The goal of Ai is to create machines that can perform tasks that are typically performed by humans and to create systems that can learn and improve over time. AI is being used in a wide range of applications, including healthcare, finance, and customer service, among others. The field of AI is constantly evolving, and researchers are continually developing new techniques to make AI systems more advanced and capable of performing increasingly complex tasks.</p>

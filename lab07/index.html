            At age 22, I served in Korea army.
            It was one of a huge challenge in my life but the environment made me keep thinking about my future.
            While I was serving in army, I felt like we are living in an era where life without computer is unimaginable.
            Thus, I decided to learn about computer and changed my college department to <strong>ischool</strong> with strong passion.

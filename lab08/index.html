            At age 22, I served in Korea army.
            It was one of a huge challenge in my life but the environment made me keep thinking about my future.
            While I was serving in army, I felt like we are living in an era where life without computer is unimaginable.
            Thus, I decided to learn about computer and changed my college department to <strong>ischool</strong> with strong passion.
            I am majoring in applied data analytics in Syracuse uinversity.
            I am taking 2 major courses: Front-End Web Dev and Database Mgnt system in this semester.
            I am Applied Data analytics major interested in examining and anticipating stock market flow.
            I did an internship in a Korean start-up company as a business development intern and served in the Korean army from November 2019 to May 2020.

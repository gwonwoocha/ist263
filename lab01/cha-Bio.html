        Gwonwoo Cha
Iâ€™m Applied Data analytics major interested in examining and anticipating stock market flow.
I did an internship in a Korean start-up company as a business development intern and served in the Korean army from November 2019 to May 2020.
My hobbies are watching Netflix and playing chess. My favorite Netflix series are Breaking bad and Queens Gambit. I started playing chess after watching Queens Gambit. My favorite sport is soccer. I was a varsity soccer player when I was in high school. My favorite soccer player is Son in Tottenham Hotspur because he is playing in one of the competitive teams in EPL and he accomplished a lot of records such as winning the Golden Boot.
